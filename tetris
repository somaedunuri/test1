Sure Ashi, I can provide the list of PI components.  It is better to provide info on how to find them because the list may change (better to go to the source itself)
 
Hi Soma,
 
In tetris we have directories naming convention for both PI and PD packages.  Here is how to find out the list of components
 
1. cd to <tetris-pkg-workspace>/package_mdata.
 
2. All PI components are stored in these files "iosxr-<pkg>/pkg-mdata/pkg_def.pl".  Please ignore any components that have been commmented out.
 
3. As for PD components are stored in these files "<plat>-<pkg>/pkg-mdata/pkg_def.pl".
 
If you have any questions, feel free to call, ST, or email.
 
Thanks,
Adisorn.
