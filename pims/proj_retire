Hi Soma,
For the retirement of lineups, the exception list is located : â€˜auto/pims-loader/PIMS/inactive_lineups/inactive_lineups.data'.

The script itself is located at /auto/pims-loader/PIMS/pims_loader_scripts/retire_projects.pl

It can be called as follows:
/auto/pims-loader/PIMS/pims_loader_scripts [167] %retire_projects.pl
Passing a file argument (--file|f) is needed to invoke this script!
==============================================================================================================
This CLI is invoked with retire_projects.pl -file /this/is/example/file.txt
The retirement file should include 1 lineup/project per line that the user wishes to retire.
The CLI will iterate through the lineups/projects in this file, and attempt to retire the projects one by one.
It'll retire what was not filtered by an exclusion list, it'll check required permissions
to retire a project/lineup are present. It'll check for any dependencies that hinder the
retirement. If none, the project and any associated throttle lists/branches will be retired
along with any ACME dependencies. The appropriate parties will also be notified.

Thanks,
Ray
