Hi Soma,
I created a temporary report called ‘soma_comp_info’ which gives only the 3 things you want : (only shows DE manager in output) It also works JSON/vs. non-JSON output:

JSON:
/auto/ioxws1/pims/raccary/pims-ws/pims/perlmod-ext/jenkins [246] %pims gsr -r soma_comp_info -comp_name aaa/lib -format json
[
   {
      "Comp Name": "aaa/lib",
      "DE Mgr": "rshree",
      "CDETS Name": "aaa-lib"
   }
]
Non-JSON:
/auto/ioxws1/pims/raccary/pims-ws/pims/perlmod-ext/jenkins [247] %pims gsr -r soma_comp_info -comp_name aaa/lib
Comp Name       CDETS Name      DE Mgr
aaa/lib aaa-lib rshree

Thanks,
Ray

Hi Soma,
That’s correct. This is how the report was designed. It returns a line for each ‘member’ who is either DE Mgr/Owner. For aaa/lib,  there’s a single DE manager and two owners; that’s why 3 lines are returned. I’m not sure why it was designed that way, but this is giving the right information.

The output can be generated in json format however as is it dumps all the output:
pims gsr -r comp_info -comp_name aaa/lib -format json
[
   {
      "Comp Code": "aaa-lib",
      "DE Mgr/Owners": "rshree",
      "Notified/Triage Alias": "q-aaa-dev",
      "Permission": "DE MGR",
      "CDETS Name": "aaa-lib",
      "Comp Name": "aaa/lib",
      "Sanity Name": "enxr_sanity",
      "CDETS Keywd": "aaa"
   },
   {
      "Comp Code": "aaa-lib",
      "DE Mgr/Owners": "gpr",
      "Notified/Triage Alias": "q-aaa-dev",
      "Permission": "Owner",
      "CDETS Name": "aaa-lib",
      "Comp Name": "aaa/lib",
      "Sanity Name": "enxr_sanity",
      "CDETS Keywd": "aaa"
   },
   {
      "Comp Code": "aaa-lib",
      "DE Mgr/Owners": "larajago",
      "Notified/Triage Alias": "q-aaa-dev",
      "Permission": "Owner",
      "CDETS Name": "aaa-lib",
      "Comp Name": "aaa/lib",
      "Sanity Name": "enxr_sanity",
      "CDETS Keywd": "aaa"
   }
]

Thanks,
Ray

Subject: How Do I interpret this data

Hi Ray,

I used “pims gsr -r comp_info” command ti get component data and seeing multiple lines.

pims gsr -r comp_info -comp_name aaa/lib
Comp Name       Comp Code       CDETS Name      Notified/Triage Alias   Permission      DE Mgr/Owners   Sanity Name     CDETS Keywd
aaa/lib aaa-lib aaa-lib q-aaa-dev       DE MGR  rshree  enxr_sanity     aaa
aaa/lib aaa-lib aaa-lib q-aaa-dev       Owner   gpr     enxr_sanity     aaa
aaa/lib aaa-lib aaa-lib q-aaa-dev       Owner   larajago        enxr_sanity     aaa

For aaa/lib component, I am looking data like this for :

Edit
All/None
Component Name	Component Code	CDETS Component	DE Manager	Category	Sanity Name	Function	Addl Platform Builds	Active	Triage Alias	Retired	Regression Suite	Last Modified Date	Last Modified By	Create Date
	aaa/lib	aaa-lib	aaa-lib	rshree	PI-Infra	enxr_sanity	 	 	yes	q-aaa-dev	no	 	Tue May 17 21:41:55 2016	cmanur	Fri Oct 13 09:38:35 2000
 
In the comp_info command, Can I specify the fields I need or use json format?
What I need is,
ACMe Comp Name
DE-Mgr           
CDETS Comp name 

Need this info 115 Comps. Hence looking for CLI option.
